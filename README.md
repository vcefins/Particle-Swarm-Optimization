Particle Swarm Optimization 

This is an optimization application assignment, confounded by Automated Robotic Systems course; employing the research paper by Riccardo Poli, James Kennedy and Tim Blackwell on their literary analysis on the field.

PSO utilizes incredibly simplified automated agents, appropriately named 'particles', to inspect a landscape for an area with the specified fitness. A basic example is a mathematical function landscape where the particles try and reach the global minima. In our example, particles can fully communicate with one another and pull them towards the lowest point found by the swarm up to that iteration. Particles also take into account their current momentum as well as their own findings for the coordinates with the highest fitting.
